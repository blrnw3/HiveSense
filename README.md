## HiveSense ##
Automated beehive health monitoring for beekeepers.

HiveSense is a software system to aid beekeepers monitor some simple properties of their beehive colonies.
It consists of some hardware for the physical monitoring, a web API for storing the data and allowing it to be queried, and a web application to view the hive data in real time.
Additionally, an alarms feature allows the beekeeper to be alerted when one of the measurement properties exceeds a user-defined value.
The software stack is flexible to allow hardware developers to make new sensors for measuring more advanced hive properties, which can be easily incorporated into the web API and application.
The web API is flexible so that software developers can make their own web application from the available data.
